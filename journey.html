<p >Today, I completed lesson 30 on "The complete 2022 Web development" course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. This was introduction to HTML and intermediate HTML. So far it has been good. I am aware that this is still the easy stage where things are relatively easy. I do find myself enjoying the process of creating something (a website), and probelm solving. I hope to continue the course and be consistent. So help me God!  ðŸ™Œ </p>
